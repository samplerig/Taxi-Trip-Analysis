# NYC Taxi Trip Duration

The problem statement consist of building a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

I first performed exploratory data analysis and examined potential outlier by visualising the data. The next step was modelling. I developed a neural network model for predicting the duration of taxi rides and performed feature engineering to further boost its performance.
